            <p>Born and raised in a small city in China, Shang grew up with a deep appreciation for education as a path to opportunity.

            <p>Shang holds a PhD in Economics of Education and a Master’s in International Public Policy. Her career has taken her from the halls of Columbia University, where she interned at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, to impactful roles at the World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank, where she served as an Education Economist driving national policy reforms and workforce strategies across Asia and Sub-Sahara Africa.</p>
            <p>Most recently, Shang served as a Senior Executive at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where she led digital transformation strategies for governments, universities, and public sector organizations across the Asia Pacific and European region.</p>
            <p>Through Navia Education, Shang brings her unique blend of experience in public policy, international development, corporate leadership, and technology to empower both individuals and organizations. Her mission is to help others navigate the complexities of modern careers — with clarity, courage, and confidence.</p>
            <p>She now lives in Singapore with her husband and two young children — her daily inspiration and reason to build a more inclusive, future-ready world.</p>
